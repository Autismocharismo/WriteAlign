- Writealign can be replicated by hand on every mainstream document editor and a peice of paper. however our secret sauce is the connection between story planning and the story itself. Seperated steps the old fashion way are usually unoganized and reuire signfigant tranlation. Entire clunky sections are formatted in the intial doucment and then the story is told. rather then a story have a foundation and then filling it up with word cement. WriteSlign Planning may not be for everyone, but effective writing reuires a direction. one which may or may not come with random entries.
